# go-wire-ddd

Description:
The go-wire-ddd repository is a demonstration of how to implement Dependency Injection (DI) in a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture using the Wire library in Go. DDD is an approach to software development that emphasizes the importance of domain modeling and collaboration between technical and domain experts. Wire is a compile-time dependency injection framework for Go.

### Features:

- Implementation of DDD principles in a Go application.
- Integration of the Wire library for dependency injection.
- Separation of concerns through domain-driven design patterns.
- Modular and scalable architecture suitable for medium to large-scale applications.
